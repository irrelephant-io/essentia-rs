# Alchemical Apparata

Interaction with the essentia is done through one of two actions:

- assembly of alchemical apparata;
- addition of substances into the simulation.

Both of these are done with the goal of achieving the desired result from a set of potential inputs

Each part of the apparatus is a self-contained simulation with potentially interconnected sections, where components might flow based on their form.

Most apparata have attachments which can slightly modify their function

## Apparata
### Flask/Beaker
Simplest apparata that are able to support reactions and hold
ingredients. Flasks or beakers are a typical receptacle for intermediates or final products of the reaction, but could also support simple reactions by themselves.

### Input methods:
- Addition if solids and liquids through the top;

### Output methods:
- Pouring solids and liquids out;
- Gasses escape through the top over time.

### Attachments:
- Stopper for flask - prevents the gases from leaking out
- Cannula for flask - allows for pressurised connection of two apparata components


## Condenser
Simple apparatus that affects the temperature of the ingredients passing through. Used as an intermediate component to assemble distillation apparata, where evaporated gas comes in through a cannula and gets condenced into the liquid form to be collected in a beaker of flask.

### Input methods:
- Gas input via attached canula

### Output methods:
- Liquid output falls out the bottom
