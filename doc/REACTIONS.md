# Built-in Reactions

By default, Essentia includes a set of reactions that are common to all alchemical systems. These include:

- Form transition
- Solution
- Precipitation


## Form transition
This is a process of changing the form of a normal substance via environment modifications. For example, transition of liquid water into water vapour under heat or condensation of gas into liquid under chill.

The form transition are governed by the essence configuration.

## Solution & Precipitation
Solution is a process of soluble solids dissolving into liquids in a system until a [solubility equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility_equilibrium) is reached.

Precipitation is a process of compounds coming out of solution due to a shift in solubility equilibrium, either through reduction of the amount of solvent or another change in environment.

Those two processes typically occur at the same time and are both governed by properties of the solvent's and solution's respective essence configuration.
